This repository holds the source code for the *No Rotten Hemogen* mod. Additionally, there are release builds available for those who own RimWorld on non-steam platforms.
**If you are here to download a copy of the mod to use in-game, download one of the [releases](https://github.com/Clementsaic/NoRottenHemogen/releases/latest).**
Only the releases contain the DLL needed for the mod to work, the repository itself is just for the source code.

kthxbye
